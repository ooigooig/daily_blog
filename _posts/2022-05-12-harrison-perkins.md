帮助会众定睛基督，而不是他们感觉如何；帮助他们看见祂的荣美，而不是质疑他们思想祂的荣美到了何等完全的程度；鼓励他们把基督丰丰富富藏在心里，兴旺灵命。——Harrison Perkins

Although this is not wholly inaccurate, believers often need help taking steps in sanctification, frequently failing most when they perceive sanctification to be “all or nothing” rather than progressive. We need more focus on helping people *grow* in the Christian life. Teaching about growth fans the flames of affections, helping people focus on Christ more than on how they feel, seeing his beauty rather than questioning how well they’re thinking about his beauty, and prompting them to thrive in treasuring him up richly in their hearts.
